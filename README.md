# Robotic Manipulation Visual Learning Tools

This is the final project for the 3766 Intro to Robotic Manipulation course, instructed by Vinicius Prado da Fonseca 
The goal of this project is to create an interactive website that offers visual learning tools for key topics in robotic manipulation, such as forward and inverse kinematics.  

These tools are designed to support both students and educators by making complex concepts more accessible and engaging through visual demonstrations.
